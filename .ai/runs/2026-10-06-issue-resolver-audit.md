# Issue resolver audit — 2026-10-06

## Goal
Select the five most urgent actionable open GitHub defects and delegate root cause, fixes, tests and separate PR creation to Codex gpt-5.6-luna children.

## Scope
Audit all open issues against existing PRs, main and active claims. Parent orchestrates only. Children own independent fixes and their PRs. A final independent review checks the orchestration branch and all child PRs before the final report. No merges into main, no duplicate fixes, no unrelated features.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Audit
1.1 Rank five actionable uncovered defects with disjoint scopes; exclude already fixed, claimed and covered work.
### Phase 2: Delegate
2.1 Dispatch up to five implementation children (four concurrent maximum), each creating and validating its own PR.
### Phase 3: Verify
3.1 Validate child reports and their changed files/test evidence without merging unreviewed changes.
3.2 Dispatch one final review child against the parent branch, covering the child PR heads; wait for verdict and report.

## Risks
Issue labels can be stale; urgency ranking is provisional until source verification. Existing PRs may cover reports without closing keywords. At most eight children total, including audit and final review. No model substitution: live catalog confirms gpt-5.6-luna. Dispatch CLI needs CEZ_API_URL=http://172.17.0.1:4321 on this host (observed serve bind address); inherited loopback URL refuses connections.

## Progress

> Convention: `- [ ]` pending, `- [x]` done. Append ` — <commit sha>` when a step lands. Do not rename step titles.

### Phase 1: Audit
- [x] 1.1 Rank five actionable uncovered defects with disjoint scopes — audited at 02634469
### Phase 2: Delegate
- [x] 2.1 Dispatch five implementation children — all codex/gpt-5.6-luna
### Phase 3: Verify
- [ ] 3.1 Validate child reports and evidence
- [ ] 3.2 Obtain final independent review and report

## Audit verification
The first audit report is not accepted: #997 is covered by #1154, #1001 by #1174, and #1077 is discussed in #1127 with contrary root-cause evidence. Assignee-only conflicts must follow ANY-signal claim rules, not an all-three requirement. #870 belongs to another assignee and needs explicit stale-lock evidence before takeover. Commission a corrected read-only audit (second child); retain #890 as a candidate. Eight-task allowance now reserved as two audits, five implementers, one final reviewer.

## Selected independent work
Ranked among uncovered, actionable work (higher-severity reports are already covered or fixed):
1. #701: real-process test teardown/liveness across named server suites; affects trust in validation. Scope excludes auto-resume and GitHub UI tests.
2. #804: auto-resume teardown and GitHub template-stacking tests; recent CI recurrence October 2. Scope only those two suites.
3. #890: non-root browser dependency fallback; blocks UI QA. Already dispatched to 7caa29a8.
4. #894: Pi configuration catalog and Settings descriptor missing despite supported runner. Scope catalog/Pi settings and descriptor/section tests.
5. #870: narrow model-picker description clipping. Scope picker-pill component/tests only. Foreign assignee wojciechszyjka last activity August 11 (assignment/labels, no comments, no covering PR); use transparent stale-lock recovery under claim-pr.md and restore assignee on handback.

Corrected audit was partially accepted: #894/#701 evidence checked; #1007 rejected because #1128 already fixes it. Parent independently searched all 121 PR bodies/titles for numeric issue references and inspected source and live issue metadata for these five. #804 has recent recurrence evidence but must reverify each half before changing it; no artificial defect or weak test allowed. All implementers must recheck coverage/claims immediately before work.

## Initial verification: #890 / PR #1294
Child head 32e33c48: parent inspected descriptor, fixture and generated-script diff. Independently reran shell fixture: PASS on fixed head, RED (exit 1, BROWSER_INSTALLED=0) against exact origin/main descriptor. Changes also reach .ai/scripts/test-env-up.sh and e2e.sh to preserve required environment; final reviewer must inspect this justified scope extension. Fixture propagation assertions use a synthetic JSON object rather than actual generated launcher, so actual propagation remains a review/testing concern. Full gate and live-browser limitations remain unresolved; draft/partial is accurate. PR inherits parent audit plan from fork; remove that unrelated artifact in final cleanup if safe. No code merged.
Fifth implementation dispatched: #870 b9563f2a-c892-4fe0-a8d5-da19aa701230. Total seven children used (two audits, five implementation), exactly one final-review task reserved.

## Initial verification: #701 / PR #1295
At head 9b81ddc7 parent repeated env-cleared lease/isolation/autosave tests: 3 files, 12 tests PASS. Diff remains test-only, but NOT yet accepted: run-store-cleanup.ts monkeypatches RunStore.open globally and replaces private scheduleSave with a no-op. This can conceal late activity instead of proving teardown is drained; no deterministic regression assertion for this helper was added. Existing flush writes synchronously and cancels its timer, so PR prose claiming it waits for asynchronous writes is unsupported. Final reviewer must resolve this, validate actual lifecycle causality and correct completion/closure claims. Full configured gate unresolved; Linux-only evidence. Sibling #804 notified to avoid same masking pattern.
